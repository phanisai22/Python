* #### Encalsulation
  + Hiding data within a class, preventing anything outside the class from directly interacting with it.
    - setters and getters	

* ### Abstraction
  + Only showing essential details and keeping everything else hidden. (Ex smart phone)
  + Abstraction needs changes RARELY.

* ### Inheritance
  + Allows classes to derive from other classes.
    - Code reusability
  + Most of the time parent class itself does't mean anything.
    - eg - Animal class has no meaning by itself untill classes like dog, tiger etc derive it.

* ### Polymorphism
  + Methods that are able to take on many forms
  + Two types :
    - **Dynamic polymorphism**:
			- occurs during run time (Method Overriding)
    - **Static polymorphism**:
			- In the same class, with different *number* of parameters, different *types* of parameters, different *order* of parameters. (Method Overloading)
